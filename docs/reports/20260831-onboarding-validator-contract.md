# Onboarding Validator Contract

Contract: `monitoring-onboarding-readiness-v1`. The output is persisted on the watchlist row and contains completed, blocking, and safe-unavailable requirements with stage-level evidence. Evaluation is read-only; only the coordinator applies state.

`PLACEHOLDER_PROFILE_COUNTS_AS_READY = 0` because the validator requires structured company fields as well as provenance.
